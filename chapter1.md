# vimtutor

Welcome to the VIM Tutor - Version 1.7

Vim is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to explain in a tutor such as this.  This tutor is designed to describe enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as an all-purpose editor.

The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes, depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.

**ATTENTION**:

The commands in the lessons will modify the text.  Make a copy of this file to practise on (if you started "vimtutor" this is already a copy).

It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by use.  That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!

Now, make sure that your Shift-Lock key is NOT depressed and press the   **j** key enough times to move the cursor so that Lesson 1.1 completely fills the screen.
