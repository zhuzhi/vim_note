# Lesson 2.6: OPERATING ON LINES

** Type  dd   to delete a whole line. **

Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Vi decided it would be easier to simply type two d's to delete a line.

1. Move the cursor to the second line in the phrase below.

2. Type  dd  to delete the line.

3. Now move to the fourth line.

4. Type   2dd   to delete two lines.

--->  1)  Roses are red,
--->  2)  Mud is fun,
--->  3)  Violets are blue,
--->  4)  I have a car,
--->  5)  Clocks tell time,
--->  6)  Sugar is sweet
--->  7)  And so are you.
