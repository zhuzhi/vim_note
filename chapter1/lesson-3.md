# Lesson 3 SUMMARY

1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type   **p** .  This puts the deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the line below the cursor).

2. To replace the character under the cursor, type   **r**   and then the character you want to have there.

3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of the word,  **c$**  to change to the end of a line.

4. The format for change is:
{% center %}**c   [number]   motion**{% endcenter %}
