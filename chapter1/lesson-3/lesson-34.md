# Lesson 3.4: MORE CHANGES USING c

** The change operator is used with the same motions as delete. **

1. The change operator works in the same way as delete.  The format is:
{% center %}**c    [number]   motion**{% endcenter %}

2. The motions are the same, such as   **w** (word) and  **$** (end of line).

3. Move to the first line below marked --->.

4. Move the cursor to the first error.

5. Type  **c$**  and type the rest of the line like the second and press **< ESC >**.
---> The end of this line needs some help to make it like the second.
---> The end of this line needs to be corrected using the  c$  command.

NOTE:  You can use the Backspace key to correct mistakes while typing.
