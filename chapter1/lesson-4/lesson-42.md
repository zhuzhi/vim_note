# Lesson 4.2: THE SEARCH COMMAND

** Type  /  followed by a phrase to search for the phrase. **
  
1. In Normal mode type the  /  character.  Notice that it and the cursor appear at the bottom of the screen as with the  :  command.

2. Now type 'errroor' <ENTER>.  This is the word you want to search for.

3. To search for the same phrase again, simply type  n .
To search for the same phrase in the opposite direction, type  N .

4. To search for a phrase in the backward direction, use  ?  instead of  / .

5. To go back to where you came from press  CTRL-O  (Keep Ctrl down while pressing the letter o).  Repeat to go back further.  CTRL-I goes forward.
--->  "errroor" is not the way to spell error;  errroor is an error.

NOTE: When the search reaches the end of the file it will continue at the start, unless the 'wrapscan' option has been reset.
