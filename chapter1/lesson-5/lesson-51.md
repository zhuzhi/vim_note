# Lesson 5.1: HOW TO EXECUTE AN EXTERNAL COMMAND

** Type  :!  followed by an external command to execute that command. **

1. Type the familiar command  **:**  to set the cursor at the bottom of the screen.  This allows you to enter a command-line command.

2. Now type the  **!**  (exclamation point) character.  This allows you to execute any external shell command.

3. As an example type   **ls**   following the **!** and then hit **< ENTER >**.  This will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were at the shell prompt.  Or use  **:!dir**  if **ls** doesn't work.

NOTE:  It is possible to execute any external command this way, also with arguments.

NOTE:  All  **:**  commands must be finished by hitting **< ENTER >** From here on we will not always mention it.
