# Lesson 5.2: MORE ON WRITING FILES

** To save the changes made to the text, type  :w FILENAME. **

1. Type  **:!dir**  or  **:!ls**  to get a listing of your directory. You already know you must hit **< ENTER >** after this.

2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.

3. Now type:   **:w TEST**   (where TEST is the filename you chose.)

4. This saves the whole file (the Vim Tutor) under the name TEST. To verify this, type    **:!dir**  or  **:!ls**   again to see your directory.
NOTE: If you were to exit Vim and start it again with  vim TEST , the file would be an exact copy of the tutor when you saved it.

5. Now remove the file by typing 
 - (MS-DOS):    **:!del TEST**
 - (Unix):      **:!rm TEST**
