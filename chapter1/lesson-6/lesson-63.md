# Lesson 6.3: ANOTHER WAY TO REPLACE

** Type a capital  R  to replace more than one character. **

1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.  Move the cursor to the beginning of the first  xxx .

2. Now press  R  and type the number below it in the second line, so that it replaces the xxx .

3. Press <ESC> to leave Replace mode.  Notice that the rest of the line remains unmodified.

4. Repeat the steps to replace the remaining xxx.
---> Adding 123 to xxx gives you xxx.
---> Adding 123 to 456 gives you 579.

NOTE:  Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an existing character.
