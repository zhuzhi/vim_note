# Lesson 6.5: SET OPTION

** Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case **

1. Search for 'ignore' by entering:   **/ignore  < ENTER >** Repeat several times by pressing  n .

2. Set the '**ic**' (Ignore case) option by entering:   **:set ic**

3. Now search for 'ignore' again by pressing  n Notice that Ignore and IGNORE are now also found.

4. Set the 'hlsearch' and 'incsearch' options:  **:set hls is**

5. Now type the search command again and see what happens:  **/ignore < ENTER >
**
6. To disable ignoring case enter:  **:set noic**

NOTE:  To remove the highlighting of matches enter:   **:nohlsearch**
NOTE:  If you want to ignore case for just one search command, use  \c in the phrase:  **/ignore\c  < ENTER >**
