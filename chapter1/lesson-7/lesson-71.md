# Lesson 7.1: GETTING HELP

** Use the on-line help system **

Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, try one of these three:
 - press the **< HELP >** key (if you have one)
 - press the **< F1 >** key (if you have one)
 - type   **:help < ENTER >**

Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.
 - Type  **CTRL-W CTRL-W**   to jump from one window to another.
 - Type    **:q < ENTER >**    to close the help window.

You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the ":help" command.  Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):
 - :help w
 - :help c_CTRL-D
 - :help insert-index
 - :help user-manual
