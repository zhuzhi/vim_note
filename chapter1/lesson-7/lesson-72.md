# Lesson 7.2: CREATE A STARTUP SCRIPT

** Enable Vim features **

Vim has many more features than Vi, but most of them are disabled by default.  To start using more features you have to create a "vimrc" file.

1. Start editing the "vimrc" file.  This depends on your system:
 - **:e ~/.vimrc**             for Unix
 - **:e $VIM/_vimrc**          for MS-Windows

2. Now read the example "vimrc" file contents:
 - **:r $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim**

3. Write the file with:
 **- :w**

The next time you start Vim it will use syntax highlighting. You can add all your preferred settings to this "vimrc" file. For more information type  :help vimrc-intro
