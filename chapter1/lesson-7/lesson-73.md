# Lesson 7.3: COMPLETION

** Command line completion with CTRL-D and <TAB> **

1. Make sure Vim is not in compatible mode:  **:set nocp**

2. Look what files exist in the directory:  **:!ls**   or  **:!dir**

3. Type the start of a command:  **:e**

4. Press  **CTRL-D ** and Vim will show a list of commands that start with "**e**".

5. Press **< TAB > ** and Vim will complete the command name to "**:edit**".

6. Now add a space and the start of an existing file name:  **:edit FIL**

7. Press **< TAB >**.  Vim will complete the name (if it is unique).

NOTE:  Completion works for many commands.  Just try pressing CTRL-D and **< TAB >**.  It is especially useful for  :help .
